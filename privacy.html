                    <p>FlipperHelper ("we", "our", or "us") is operated by Oleksandr Prudnikov, a sole trader registered in the United Kingdom. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our iOS application ("FlipperHelper" or the "App").</p>
                    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices. This policy applies to users in the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and all other regions where the App is available.</p>

                    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

                    <ul>

                    <h3>No External Servers</h3>
                    <p>FlipperHelper does not operate any servers. Your data is never transmitted to us. The only external service is Google Drive, which you control and can disconnect at any time.</p>

                        <li><strong>Google Drive Sync:</strong> When you choose to back up photos or export data to your own Google Drive account.</li>
                        <li><strong>Device Backups:</strong> If you back up your iPhone via iCloud or iTunes, App data may be included in those backups (controlled by Apple).</li>
                    </ul>
